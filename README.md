# TopRankCoding
This is a collection of original C++ and JAVA functions that solve the most common coding questions that are asked during job interviews for software engineers/programmers and quants by the top tech companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Wall street financial firms like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan ..
These functions are different from all the other solutions on the internet that the codes here are globally top ranked by a very popular on line coding website.
The reasons for the functions to be top ranked globally are the following:
1.  Execution speed. These are the fastest algorithm.
2.  Code size. Most of the codes use the least amount of codes to solve the problem, comparing to other solutions on the internet.
3.  Simple and Intuitive. This is the only way to code and to prepare for a interview.
4.  Use latest and state of art technology like C++ 11, JAVA 8 and plenty of Lambdas.

Use Visual Studio for C++ code and Eclipse for JAVA code.
I hope by publication of these codes will help all the aspiring software engineers/programmers and quants to get ready for their job interviews to land their dream job.
Computer programms are always dynamic and forever changing landscape. Some other very smart programmers will undoubtedly will come up with even better solution in the future. This is just adding my few drops to the unlimited ocean of software engineering.
